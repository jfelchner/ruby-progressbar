  * Add an error specifically for invalid progress so that, in parent libraries,
    it can be caught properly
  * Use the splat operator just to be clear
  * Fix an issue with the estimated timers blowing up if the total was nil -
    Closes #62
  * Changed my mind. Rather than checking if the bar is stopped/started just
    blow up when the attempt is made to increment/decrement the bar to an invalid
    value
  * Remove the CannotUpdateStoppedBarError
  * Changes to the total should also be considered a change in progress and
    should therefore not be allowed for a stopped bar
  * Add a warning that any changes to progress while the bar is stopped, will
    eventually be an exception
  * Use the helper to divide the seconds. Don't know why I didn't do this before
  * When finishing the bar, we also should stop the timers
  * When checking 'finished?' make sure we check all progressables

    not the DEFAULT_TOTAL. Even though they currently happen to be the same
    number.
  * return DEFAULT_TOTAL for percentage_completed of total is zero, fixing
    ZeroDivisionError
  * Use io/console where available.
  * Add tmux notifications to Guardfile
  * Bundler is not a development dependency
  * Hashes are not ordered and therefore when looking for the time mocking
    method, we weren't selecting the proper one. Switched to an Array instead.
  * Update development gems
  * Move ruby-prof into the Gemfile so it is only loaded when it's MRI Ruby
  * Add a script for benchmarking
  * Now that we're memoizing Format::Base#bar_molecules, just use it to
    calculate how many bar molecules are left
  * Limit the API of the Format.Base class by making #non_bar_molecules and
    #bar_molecules private
  * Move Formatter#process into Format::Base because it is much more concerned
    with the format
  * Remove the Kernel#tap in Formatter#process and just use an instance variable

    reparse it
  * Extract the logic of setting the format string out into its own private

    space it was taking up
  * fix @terminal_width and bar_width calculation
  * Fix more README typos
  * Set the default bar mark to '='
  * Make sure to blow up if a molecule is not value
  * It's not sufficient to say that a molecule is 'a percent sign followed by
    something that isn't a percent sign', we need to force it to be followed by a
    letter
  * Fix &nbsp; problems in the README
  * Update the formatting to make sure the %b and %i formatting molecules can
    coexist with each other
  * Now that we can use the %b and %i flags, we can create a mirrored bar simply
    by using a format string of '%i%b' and therefore this extra code is no longer
    necessary
  * Make sure that when the timer is started, then stopped, then started again,
    it should not register as `stopped?`
  * Allow %i to be used display the incomplete space of the bar
  * Update `ProgressBar::Formatter#format` to reset the bar style to default if
    it is called without passing in a format string
  * Allow the %b molecule to be used to display the bar only without incomplete
    space
  * Update the %B format test to be more reasonable
  * Make the %w molecule only return the bar with the percentage instead of
    including empty space
  * Remove the `length` argument when calling
    `ProgressBar::Components::Bar#to_s` and instead set the attribute
  * Rename `ProgressBar::Formatter#bar` to `#complete_bar`
  * Change the %b (bar with percentage) format molecule to %w
  * Swap the meaning of the %b and %B molecules
  * There was a typo in the example formats in the README. The literal percent
    sign needs to be included in the format string
  * Make sure the '%%' molecule is formatted properly
  * Little refactoring on the `ProgressBar::Formatter#process` method
  * README update
  * Remove all of the `ProgressBar::Base#update` calls and convert to method
    calls that take a block `#with_update`

  * Add 'It's better than some other library' section to the README
  * Add contributors to the README
  * Add supported Rubies to the README

  * If Time is being mocked via Delorean, make sure that the progress bar always
    uses the unmocked time
  * If Time is being mocked via Timecop, make sure that the progress bar always
    uses the unmocked time
  * When testing, make sure that we're able to always get the proper version of
    `now` that we need for our particular spec
  * When calling `ProgressBar::Time.now` allow a Time-like object to be passed
    in
  * Add a `ruby-progressbar`-specific implementation of Time to encapsulate the
    business logic
  * Extract the notion of `now` into a method on the `Timer` module
  * Remove extra `private`
  * Use inheritance to put `title=` in the Formatter module where it belongs
  * I didn't notice that #total and #progress were available in the Formatter
    module
  * Move logic specific to the modules into those modules and use the
    inheritance chain to get at them
  * Evidently Travis is having issues with Rubinius so we'll remove them from
    our .travis.yml file to get a passing build
  * Try and get better 1.8.7 compatibility when checking the end character in
    the progressbar string
  * Add the Travis-CI build status to the README
  * Add the Travis-CI configuration file
  * Update the other deprecation warnings outside of `ProgressBar::Base`
  * Add the remaining method deprecation/warning messages
  * Use a little metaprogramming to further dry up the deprecation messages
  * fixup! c3e6991988107ab45ac3dac380750b287db3bc2e
  * When displaying deprecation warnings for methods, only show them one time;
    not every time the method is invoked
  * Dry up the warning messages in `ProgressBar::Depreciable`
  * Move `ProgressBar::Base#backwards_compatible_args_to_options_conversion` to
    the `ProgressBar::Depreciable` module
  * Add a new `ProgressBar::Depreciable` module to encapsulate all of the
    deprecation logic
  * Forgot to return the `options` hash from
    `ProgressBar::Base#backwards_compatible_args_to_options_conversion`
  * Add the old `bar_mark=` method back so it's more backwards compatible

  * Add `ProgressBar::Base#progress` and `#total`
  * Update the gemspec
  * Update the `EstimatedTimer` specs when smoothing is turned off such that the
    `#decrement` spec is sufficiently different from the smoothing on `#decrement`
    spec
  * Update `EstimatedTimer` specs when smoothing is turned off to be more
    consistent with the new smoothing specs
  * Add `EstimatedTimer` specs to test when smoothing is turned on
  * Update the spec text for the `EstimatedTimer` class so that it doesn't
    contain the actual expected value but rather the general expectation
  * Extract `smoothing` into its own `let` variable
  * Add notes to the README about smoothing
  * Invert the smoothing value such that 0.0 is no smoothing and 1.0 is maximum
    smoothing
  * Set the default smoothing value to 0.9
  * Convert the `EstimatedTime#estimated_seconds_remaining` over to using the
    running average
  * Tell the `Progressable` module to update the running average any time the
    `progress` is set
  * Add the notion of a `smoothing` variable to the `Progressable` module for
    use when calculating the running average
  * Introduce `Progressable#running_average` and reset it any time
    `Progressable#start` is called
