## Submitting an Issue

We use the GitHub issue tracker to track bugs and features. Before submitting
a bug report or feature request, check to make sure it hasn't already been

a stack trace and any details that may be necessary to reproduce the bug.
Ideally, a bug report should include a pull request with failing specs.
